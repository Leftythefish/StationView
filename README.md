## StationView 
A simple web-page to quickly show relevant public transportation options from a set station, instead of having to use several clicks to upload start - and end-stations to a route manager application.
## Background
Idea was to practise using JS and a public API in a simple project. 
## Future plans
Cleaning up code, possibly adding funtion to select from a few stations instead of one fixed location.
